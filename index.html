__About__

__js-vim__ is an open-source project to implement __Vim__ in web-friendly JavaScript.

__Vim__ itself is an improved implementation of the __Vi__ text editor.

Bram Moolenar is the main author of __Vim__; his effort richly deserves [sponsorship](http://www.vim.org/sponsor/).

The _js-vim_ project lives at [github.com/itsjoesullivan/js-vim](https://github.com/itsjoesullivan/js-vim), and issues should be reported to [github.com/itsjoesullivan/js-vim/issues](https://github.com/itsjoesullivan/js-vim/issues).

_js-vim_ is available for use under the __MIT__ license.



================================


__Features__

Vim's power and flexibility arise from over 20 years of coordinated effort. _js-vim_ aims to lay a foundation that can support such continued investment while bringing a quorum of Vim's features to web users.
